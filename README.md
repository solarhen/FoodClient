# FoodClient
FoodClient is a pvp client by my friend.
don't expect any updates, cause the dev is working on a new project called "annihilation client" (a new hacked client)!
# how to download n' install
this is a 8.9 pvp client, and you need to install it manually.
1. download the FoodClient zip from the releases tap.
2. extract it.
3. go to your versions folder in the appdata.
4. put the extracted folder in the versions folder.
5. go to minecraft luncher.
6. create a new installetion, and choose the FoodClient.
7. enjoy.
